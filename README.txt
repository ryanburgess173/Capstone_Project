Greetings, in order to run the .exe file in the root directory of this folder,
you will first need to install the x86 (32-bit) version of Microsoft Access
Runtime 2013. This must be the exact install you choose from the link below:

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39358

In addition, make sure the .accdb and .exe are placed in the same path.
All you need to do after that is run the .exe and enjoy viewing the data.

NOTE: As of 3/13/2019, version 1.0, the data for vendor invoices is not
viewable. This is a bug which I am in progress of fixing, a fix will be implemented
once the next version of this software is released in the coming week or two.
I included the .zip of my visual studio project just in case you wanted to
view my VB.NET source code. Thank you!
