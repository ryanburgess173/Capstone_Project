# Capstone_Project

UPDATE: Project Now Complete!!!

A system for a fictitious tailoring business for my Capstone Project, CSC-289.

I'm planning on using Visual Basic along with Access to build my system.

In order to run the program, you must first install the x86 (32-bit) Microsoft Access Runtime 2013.
