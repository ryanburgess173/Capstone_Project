# Capstone_Project
A system for a fictitious tailoring business for my Capstone Project, CSC-289. This is a working progress. Should be finished by mid-May.

I'm planning on using Visual Basic along with Access to build my system.

In order to run the program, you must first install the x86 (32-bit) Microsoft Access Runtime 2013.
